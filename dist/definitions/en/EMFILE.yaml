code  : EMFILE
errno : -7
name  : TooManyOpenFilesError
readableName : Too Many Open Files
message : Too many file currently open in the system.
explain : >
  Maximum number of file descriptors allowable on the system has been reached,
  and requests for another descriptor cannot be fulfilled until at least one
  has been closed. This is encountered when opening many files at once in
  parallel, especially on systems (in particular, OS X) where there is a low
  file descriptor limit for processes.
hints : >
  To remedy a low limit, run `ulimit -n 2048` in the same shell that will 
  run the Node.js process.
